To list the files in the folder just press Enter. Type a few characters
and press Enter to view only the names that begin with them. If there is only
one match the app will open the file. If you type a first few characters of the
name and press Tab, the app will complete the name with the first match.
Subsequent Tabs iterate over the matches.
