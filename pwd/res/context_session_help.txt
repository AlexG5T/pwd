`pwd` is a contextual REPL (read–eval–print loop) tool for managing sensitive
information (e.g. passwords, keys, notes) in openssl-encrypted YAML files. It is
a console (i.e. works in terminal) application. List of available commands
depends on the context, e.g. in the folder context the user can list files or
open them. In the file context user can edit file's content or copy fields.

To list the files in the folder just press Enter. Type a few characters
and press Enter to view only the names that begin with them. If there is only
one match the app will open the file. If you type a first few characters of the
name and press Tab, the app will complete the name with the first match.
Subsequent Tabs iterate over the matches.
